## 🛠️ How to Use/Run These Projects

### Running Locally with a Simple Server

For most web projects, you'll need a local server to run them properly (especially for features like AJAX requests or certain browser security policies).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dannz510/Web-Project.git](https://github.com/dannz510/Web-Project.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Web-Project/ProjectName
    ```
    (Replace `ProjectName` with the actual folder name of the project you want to run, e.g., `Billiard play with AI`)
3.  **Install a simple HTTP server (if you don't have one):**
    If you have Node.js and npm installed, you can use `http-server`:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```
4.  **Start the server:**
    From within the project's root directory (e.g., `Billiard play with AI/` or `Choose your dog/public/`), run:
    ```bash
    http-server
    ```
    This will typically start a server at `http://localhost:8080` (or another available port). Open your browser and navigate to the displayed URL.

### Directly from Browser (Live Demos)

You can also view live demos of most projects directly in your browser using `raw.githack.com`, which serves raw GitHub files with proper content types.
