Eh...

Right, so this is a place where I store shit I write. It's not organized. It's not pretty. But there's a lot of fun things to explore!

**I recommend:**

[PeOS](http://picturelements.github.io) - A mockup OS where all my weirdest/best scribbles are on display.

[Emojifuck](http://picturelements.github.io/emojifuck/) - Brainfuck, but in emoji.

[Sudoku Solver](https://picturelements.github.io/sudokuSolver) - a fun and fast little sudoku solver.
