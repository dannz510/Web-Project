PeOS 2.0

PeOS is written, designed, and maintained by PicturElements (github.com/PicturElements)
It's a highly functional mockup of a real OS (Windows 10) and features my small projects
as apps on the desktop. 

Disclaimer: This app, and the apps that run in it, were written at different stages of my
long (and much like too many of my projects; unfinished) journey to webdev Nirvana, so any
aneurysms you contract while spying my old code are your problem.
